# STARLET Project Data Repository :computer:
This repository contains the data generated and used by the [research group](https://mysite.ku.edu.tr/skeskin/) of Prof. Seda Keskin in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Ko√ß University for the ERC-funded STARLET (Atomistic Modeling of Advanced Porous Materials for Energy, Environment, and Biomedical Applications) project. STARLET focuses on advancing the understanding of nanoporous materials and their applications in gas adsorption, separation, and related fields using computational and machine learning approaches.

## Overview

This repository hosts datasets used for:

- Molecular simulation data of nanoporous materials such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and their composites with ionic liquids and polymers.

- Investigating adsorption and separation processes for gases like CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, CO, SF<sub>6</sub>, and others.

- Training and validating machine learning models.

- The data files are provided in formats compatible with common computational chemistry and data analysis tools.

## Data Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **datasets/**: Includes raw and processed datasets relevant to MOF and COF research.
  - `MOF_data.csv`: Dataset for metal-organic frameworks.
  - `COF_data.csv`: Dataset for covalent organic frameworks.
  - Additional datasets can be added as needed.
  
- **models/**: Contains files related to training and testing machine learning models.
  
- **scripts/**: Includes Python or other language scripts for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and analysis.

- **README.md**: Documentation for understanding the repository structure and usage.

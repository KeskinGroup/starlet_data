# STARLET Data Repository
This repository contains the data generated and used by the research group of Prof. Seda Keskin for the STARLET (Atomistic Modeling of Advanced Porous Materials for Energy, Environment, and Biomedical Applications) project. STARLET focuses on advancing the understanding of nanoporous materials and their applications in gas adsorption, separation, and related fields using computational and machine learning approaches.

Overview

This repository hosts datasets used for:

Training and validating machine learning models.

Evaluating molecular simulations of nanoporous materials such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and composites.

Investigating adsorption and separation processes for gases like CO2, CH4, H2, N2, O2, CO, SF6, and others.

The data files are provided in formats compatible with common computational chemistry and data analysis tools.
